## users (This will store information about each user of the chat application.)
id,
username,
email,
password,
profile_picture,
created_at,
updated_at,

## messages(Stores individual messages sent by users.)
id,
sender_id,
receiver_id,
content,
created_at,
status (sent, delivered, read)

## conversations(This table represents a conversation between two or more users.)
id,
conversation_name,
created_at,
updated_at,

## conversation_participants(For group chats, this table stores which users belong to which conversations.)
id,
conversation_id,
user_id,
joind_at,

## message_attachments(If your chat supports media or file attachments (images, videos, etc.).)
id,
message_id,
file_url,
file_type,
create_at,

## message_reaction(If users can react to messages (e.g., like, emoji reactions).)
id,
message_id,
user_id,
reactin_type,
created_at,


## Relationships:
A user can participate in many conversations.
A conversation can have many messages.
A message can have many attachments and reactions.
A user can send many messages to other users.

## Example Query:

# Fetch all messages in a conversation:
# sql query
`SELECT m.content, m.created_at, u.username
FROM messages m
JOIN users u ON m.sender_id = u.user_id
WHERE m.conversation_id = ?
ORDER BY m.created_at;`

note: This design can be expanded with more features like message status (sent, delivered, read), push notifications, and even encryption for message contents, depending on your specific requirements.
